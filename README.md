# rewards-program-ui
## Overview
This rewards program allows customers to earn points based on their purchases. The points are calculated as follows:

For every dollar spent over $100 in a transaction, the customer receives 2 points.
For every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in a transaction, the customer receives 1 point.

## Example Calculation
Suppose a customer makes a purchase of $120. Here’s how we calculate the points:

Amount spent over $100: $120 - $100 = $20
Points for this portion: 2 points/dollar × $20 = 40 points
Amount spent between $50 and $100: $100 - $50 = $50
Points for this portion: 1 point/dollar × $50 = 50 points
Total points earned: 40 points + 50 points = 90 points
